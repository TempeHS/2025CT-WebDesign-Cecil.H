        changehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFSwV8o77iMhttps:</P>A robot can be guided by an external control device,
    or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to
    evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality,
    rather
    than expressive aesthetics.
